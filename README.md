HoneyMond is a software dedicated to smartphone users and especially iOS or Android users for its early stage and for 3D hardware when fully developed.
HoneyMond has two faces/modes. One is the HoneyComb Face and it is the mode where work is done. The other one is the Diamond mode- Combining HoneyComb With Diamond makes the HoneyMond.
The Main Face or the HoneyComb has 7 of the most valuable internet companies combining them as one.
The Diamond face has sections that will be sold at NFT-land, until they develop into its own Metaverse Nation. 
The Bee top left corner symbolically represent if your software is in Work Mode or Pleasure Mode.
The Recycle bin bottom right is for my current business: Refurbishing and Recycling Portable electronics. 
Top Center is our own wallet regulated by the XRPL or any company that is capable of that. 
3 lines top right corner opens the App Menu containing profile, settings, messages etc... 
Every Monetary transaction will be done by crypto 1st and thru our own wallet, where I hope XRPL can come beneficial both ways.
