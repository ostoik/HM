HoneyMond is a software dedicated to smartphone users and especially iOS or Android users for its early stage and for 3D hardware when fully developed
HoneyMond has two faces/modes. One is the HoneyComb Face and it is the mode where work is done. The other one is the Diamond mode- Combining HoneyComb With Diamond makes the HoneyMond
The Main Face or the HoneyComb has 7 of the most valuble internet companies combining them as one
The Diamond face has sections that will be sold at NFT-land, until they develop into its own Metaverse Nation.
